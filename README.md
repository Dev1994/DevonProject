# DevonProject

Students must develop an application using the Android environment. The application must have three buttons. The first button must be used to call a Trailer Hire function. The second button must be used to call the Pay Calculator function. The student must use the third button to implement any functionality of their choice. The application must be tested on the students’ allocated Android device before submission.

Trailer Hire
David rents a trailer to remove rubble from his farm to the garbage collection zone. The basic cost is R300 per day plus a specific amount that must be entered by him per kilometre travelled. If David travelled less than 40 kilometres, an additional surcharge of 5% is payable on the amount due for the distance. However, if he used the trailer for more than 200 kilometres, he receives a discount of 11% on the amount due for distance. Calculate and display the amount due for distance and the total amount that he owes the company that owns the trailer.

Pay Calculator
XYZ Company employees are paid a certain rate per hour. The company wants to modify the rate as follows.
   If the number of hours worked is 40 and the rate per hour is less than R28.50, the system must increase the rate by R1.50.
   If the number of hours is 40 and the rate per hour is R28.50 or more, the system must increase the rate by R1.20.
   If the number of hours worked is greater than 40 and the rate per hour is greater than or equal to R28.50, the system must increase       the rate per hour by 1.5%.
   If the number of hours is less than 40, the system must decrease the rate per hour by R0.50 per hour.
